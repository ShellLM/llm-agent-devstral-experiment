    88	### Task Breakdown:
    89	
    90	#### Independent Tasks:
    91	1. **Explore the `.agent` Directory:**
    92	   - List the contents of the `.agent` directory.
    93	   - Identify any interesting files or directories.
    94	
    95	2. **Research the `llm` Command-Line Tool:**
    96	   - Read the `LLM_CLI.md` file for instructions on using the `llm` command-line tool.
    97	   - Identify how to use the `llm` tool to interact with documents using fragments.
    98	
    99	3. **Write an Introduction to the Deepbloom Experiment:**
   100	   - Research the deepbloom experiment.

   143	   ```
   144	
   145	### Final Steps:
   146	- **Zenity Input Box:**
   147	  - Use Zenity to prompt for confirmation before committing changes.

   150	  ```
   151	
   152	### Conclusion:
   153	By breaking down the task into smaller, manageable parts and ensuring all available context is provided, we can execute the task efficiently and accurately.


Do the needfull. create a subagent for each independent task and then complete the remaining tasks yourself.
WARNING: You MUST NOT call multiple deepbloom requests from the same dir (every turn your working dir sets to the one you started in) it causes problems due to the nature of each deepbloom process requiring a lock on .agent where it writes its prompts and processes responses. Therefor, when you do run parallel deepbloom agents, you must first create git worktree ABOVE this directory, cd into it and call the deepbloom function from there with the task. Prompting it commit and then either a PR or another automated merge process that you, as the main agent can undertake.

If that works think of something else to show off your skills and document the progress in the gh repo.

e.g. 
<CODE>
mkdir ~/Projects/llm-agent-experiments && cd ~/Projects/llm-agent-devstral
gh repo clone shelllm/llm-agent-devstral
git worktree command
</CODE>
<CODE>
cd ~/Projects/llm-agent-experiments
deepbloom 'read file/path containing instructions for work needed in project. Commit and push frequently to your branch. Then merge to main or PR and then summarise your work and exit
</CODE>
